# Urban-Traffic-Crash-Analysis-Using-Deep-Learning-Techniques
The project aims to address the alarming surge in road accidents in Andhra Pradesh during
2021, which witnessed a 20 percent increase in such incidents. The stateâ€™s unfortunate rank
of eighth in terms of fatalities, with 8,946 lives lost in 22,311 traffic accidents, highlights the
urgency of the situation. The substantial economic impact on the victims and their families
emphasizes the need for effective measures to mitigate road accidents. The project proposes
a framework that collects accident data from key regions, namely Patamata, Penamaluru,
Mylavaram, Krishnalanka, Ibrahimpatnam and Gandhinagar in Vijayawada from 2019 to
2021. The dataset comprises over 12,000 records of accident data from diverse areas. Deep
learning techniques are applied to classify the severity of road accidents into fatal, grievous,
and severe injuries. The classification process leverages advanced neural network models,
including the Recurrent Neural Network, Multilayer Perceptron, Long-Short Term Memory
and Gated Recurrent Unit. These models are trained on the collected data to accurately
predict the severity of accidents. By employing deep learning algorithms, the project aims
to provide a reliable and robust system for classifying road accidents, enabling authorities
to prioritize emergency response and allocate resources accordingly. This project seeks to
contribute to the development of proactive measures and policies for reducing the severity
and frequency of road accidents in Andhra Pradesh.
